Climate change is real.

Climate change is real.

This Project was made as a part of a school assignment.

It can simulate a thermostat in a building, which regulates the temperature of each room independently. 

The interesting stuff is in the second folder. Structures "PT1Glied" and "Thermostat" provide essential functionality, 
the rest is only used to visualise the results.
